    "This Callback allows us to easily train a network using Leslie Smith's 1cycle policy. To learn more about the 1cycle technique for training neural networks check out [Leslie Smith's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09820.pdf) and for a more graphical and intuitive explanation check out [Sylvain Gugger's post](https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use our 1cycle policy we will need an [optimum learning rate](https://sgugger.github.io/how-do-you-find-a-good-learning-rate.html). We can find this learning rate by using a learning rate finder which can be called by using [`lr_finder`](/callbacks.lr_finder.html#callbacks.lr_finder). It will do a mock training by going over a large range of learning rates, then plot them against the losses. We will pick a value a bit before the minimum, where the loss still improves. Our graph would look something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here anything between `3x10^-2` and `10^-2` is a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will apply the 1cycle policy with the chosen learning rate as the maximum learning rate. The original 1cycle policy has three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We progressively increase our learning rate from lr_max/div_factor to lr_max and at the same time we progressively decrease our momentum from mom_max to mom_min.\n",
    "    2. We do the exact opposite: we progressively decrease our learning rate from lr_max to lr_max/div_factor and at the same time we progressively increase our momentum from mom_min to mom_max.\n",
    "    3. We further decrease our learning rate from lr_max/div_factor to lr_max/(div_factor x 100) and we keep momentum steady at mom_max.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "Unpublished work has shown even better results by using only two phases: the same phase 1, followed by a second phase where we do a cosine annealing from lr_max to 0. The momentum goes from mom_min to mom_max by following the symmetric cosine (see graph a bit below)."
